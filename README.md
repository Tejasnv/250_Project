VOR Simulator (250_Project)
===========

Designing and implemeting VHF Omni Directional Radio Range (VOR) using java.
Background : VOR is a type of radio beacon that provides directional information.
these signals are continuesly transmitted by Ground unit are read by VOR receiver in plane. 
With reference to these signal and current position of plane pilote determines if the curret 
path is desired path or not.

Project : Develope an GUI where user can input current Location of Plane in terms of radial and 
system should show how fare away plane is from designated path in terms of displacement in compas 
needle and required changes to be made in direction of place to follow desired path.
